                <p>Discover the perfect wines to complement your favorite dishes. Find wines that pair perfectly with meat, fish, poultry, cheese, and vegetables. <br><br>
                    We leveraged Hugging Face's zero-shot classification to analyze wine descriptions and identify which dishes pair best with each wine. For every wine, the model assigns a relevance score to various dish categories, such as meat or fish, and one or two types of dish with the highest scores are selected as the ideal pairing. This approach not only provides accurate and diverse food pairings but also enables users to filter wines based on specific dish types, enhancing the overall search experience.            </div>

    <h2 class="mb-5 text-center">Our Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset used for GrapeGuide comes from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #9d36add5; font-weight: bold;">kaggle.com</a>. The specific dataset is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinrustam/wine-dataset" target="_blank" style="color: #9d36add5; font-weight: bold;">'Wine Dataset'</a> dataset from the user <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/elvinrustam" target="_blank" style="color: #9d36add5; font-weight: bold;">Elvin Rustamov</a>. To find out the reliability of the dataset, Elvin was contacted via LinkedIn to ask how he had obtained the dataset. Elvin said that he had used a scraper to scrape the information about different wines from the Majestic Wines website. <br><br>

        The original dataset on Kaggle contains 17 unique columns and
        1289 unique wines. To ensure the quality of the dataset for use in
        GrapeGuide, wines that have an empty cell in one of the following columns were dropped: ’Title’, ’Description’, ’Price’, ’Capacity’,
        ’Grape’, ’Closure’, ’Country’, ’Unit’, ’Characteristics’, ’Type’, ’ABV’,
        ’Region’, ’Style’, ’Vintage’. It was deliberately chosen to keep wines
        with an empty cell in the columns ’Secondary Grape Varieties’ and
        ’Appellation’, as not all wines have a secondary grape variety or
        an appellation. In addition to checking for empty fields, the dataset
        was also checked for duplicate wines. Three duplicate wines were
        found, but they have different volumes. It was therefore decided to
        keep these duplicate wines in the dataset.

    To further expand the dataset, machine learning was applied to match wines with a type of dish that the wine goes well with: meat, poultry, fish, cheese, and vegetables. More about this machine learning approach can be read in Section 6. Furthermore, the dataset has been expanded with images of the wines. The images were gathered using a custom-programmed web scraper that searched for each wine's name on Google Images. Instead of downloading the images, we linked to external websites by using the URLs. Initially, 882 wines were successfully processed by searching for the first five Google Images results and selecting the first link that led to a Majestic Wine website.</p>

    However, 169 wines were not successfully processed in the first round. To address this, we created a new scraper that selected the first Google Images result, provided it was not from the website 'Vivino,' as images from Vivino often featured user-generated photos unsuitable for our website. This second attempt successfully retrieved suiting images for around 75% of the remaining wines. For the final 25% of the 169 wines without suiting images, images were manually reviewed and edited. Seven wines had to be removed because no suitable images could be found, leaving a total of 1,059 wines with images. Additionally, some websites had anti-hotlinking measures in place, which prevented us from using their images because they did not allow external linking, so we did not use those websites.</p>
