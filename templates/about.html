                <p>Discover the perfect wines to complement your favorite dishes. Find wines that pair perfectly with meat, fish, poultry, cheese, and vegetables. <br><br>
                We leveraged Hugging Face's zero-shot classification to analyze wine descriptions and identify which dishes pair best with each wine. For every wine, the model assigns a relevance score to various dish categories, such as meat or fish, and the dish with the highest score is selected as the ideal pairing. This approach not only provides accurate and diverse food pairings but also enables users to filter wines based on specific dish types, enhancing the overall search experience.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-5 text-center">Our Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset used for GrapeGuide comes from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #9d36add5; font-weight: bold;">kaggle.com</a>. The specific dataset is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinrustam/wine-dataset" target="_blank" style="color: #9d36add5; font-weight: bold;">'Wine Dataset'</a> dataset from the user <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/elvinrustam" target="_blank" style="color: #9d36add5; font-weight: bold;">Elvin Rustamov</a>. To find out the reliability of the dataset, Elvin was contacted via LinkedIn to ask how he had obtained the dataset. Elvin said that he had used a scraper to scrape the information about different wines from the Majestic Wines website. <br><br>

        The original dataset on Kaggle contains 17 unique columns and 1289 unique wines. To ensure the quality of the dataset for use in GrapeGuide, wines that have an empty cell in one of the following columns were dropped: 'Title', 'Description', 'Price', 'Capacity', 'Grape', 'Closure', 'Country', 'Unit', 'Characteristics', 'Type', 'ABV', 'Region', 'Style', 'Vintage'. It was deliberately chosen to keep wines with an empty cell in the columns 'Secondary Grape Varieties' and 'Appellation'. In addition to checking for empty fields, the dataset was also checked for duplicate wines. Three duplicate wines were found, but they have different volumes. It was therefore decided to keep these duplicate wines in the dataset.<br><br>
        
        To further expand the dataset, machine-learning (zero-shot classification) was applied to match wines with a type of dish that the wine goes well with: meat, poultry, cheese, fish, and vegetables. Furthermore, the dataset has been expanded with images of the wines. These images were obtained by using a scraper to search for the name of the wine via Google Images. The images found were added to the dataset. Subsequently, it was manually checked whether the images matched the style of the average image. For images that did not match, images that did match were manually searched for. If no good images could be found manually either, the wine was dropped from the dataset.<br><br>
