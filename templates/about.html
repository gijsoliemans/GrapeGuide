                <h4>Food Pairing</h4>
                <p>Discover the perfect wines to complement your favorite dishes. Find wines that pair perfectly with meat, fish, poultry, cheese, and vegetables. <br><br>
                We leveraged Hugging Face's zero-shot classification to analyze wine descriptions and identify which dishes pair best with each wine. For every wine, the model assigns a relevance score to various dish categories, such as meat or fish, and the dish with the highest score is selected as the ideal pairing. This approach not only provides accurate and diverse food pairings but also enables users to filter wines based on specific dish types, enhancing the overall search experience.</p>
