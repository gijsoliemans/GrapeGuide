# Assignment

The goal of this project is to organize a collection of content. Select a collection of content of interest (a dataset). Build a website that organizes this content using different approaches to information organization from both an informal and formal perspective. From the formal perspective, this includes the development of an ontology or a controlled vocabulary. Use simple machine learning to automatically tag the content according to your developed vocabulary. Describe your intended use-cases for the website (at least three different ones) and create user personas. Integrate the results into your website. You should show how the website enables these different intended interactions.

## Deliverables

- The website
- The annotated dataset
- The ontology or vocabulary in a standard format
- The final presentation
- A 5-6 page report (ACM two-column format, [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com), which should contain:
  - Description of the dataset. Reflect on how you controlled its data quality.
  - The 6-question case study template, describing the information organization
  - Expected website use cases and developed user personas
  - Your controlled vocabulary or ontology
  - Your ML approach. How does it improve your organization?
  - The site-map

Reflect on the challenges of organizing the information and how you applied the concepts presented in class. Take into account factors such as the comprehensiveness of the website, the rationale, the various organization approaches used, the application of standards, how well the organizational approaches are integrated together.

At the end of the report, there must be a statement describing the distribution of individual contributions of all members of the team to the project.
